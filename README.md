# Wine-Dataset-Analysis

The idea is to run a list of classifiers on this dataset using the best set of parameters for each classifier and then compare their performance.

List of Classifiers are:
• Decision Trees
• Perceptron (usually specified as a neural net with 0 hidden layers)
• Neural Net
• Deep Learning
• SVM
• naïve Bayes
• Logistic Regression
• k-Nearest Neighbors
• Bagging
• Random Forests
• AdaBoost
• Gradient Boosting

Technologies used: R, R-Studio.
